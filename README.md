## 🌐 Live

**[opstoolbox.dev](https://opstoolbox.dev/)** — hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.

Or run it yourself: locally for development, or in your own perimeter via the [Docker image](#-self-host-docker).

---

## ❓ Why This Exists

IT professionals reach for web utilities dozens of times a day: subnet math, JWT inspection, diagram rendering, password generation. The catch? Pasting customer network topologies, security tokens, or internal configurations into a third-party website creates compliance and data-sovereignty risk.

Ops Toolbox solves this by being **unconditionally client-side**. There is no code path that transmits input or output anywhere — the toolkit runs identically on a laptop, in a restricted enclave, or on a machine with **no network connection at all**. Verify it yourself in the DevTools Network tab: zero outbound requests during operation.

- **Runs 100% client-side** — zero data leaves the browser.
- **Deploy anywhere** — Azure Static Web Apps, any static host, `localhost`, or an air-gapped Docker instance.
- **Does one thing well** — focused utilities, not a bloated platform.

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **24 focused tools** | Networking, security, data, and developer utilities — see the [Tools](#-tools) table. |
| **Air-gap friendly** | No external calls at runtime; runs on a disconnected host with identical behavior. |
| **Privacy by construction** | No backend, no API, no analytics, no telemetry, no third-party scripts. |
| **Accessible by default** | `data-theme` theming (Light, Dark, High-Contrast Slate, System), visible focus rings, `prefers-reduced-motion` support. |
| **Testable architecture** | Pure logic extracted into `src/lib/`; 474 passing tests across 56 files (Vitest + Testing Library). |
| **Code-split per tool** | Each tool is lazy-loaded with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` — you only load what you open. |
| **Self-hostable** | A multi-stage Docker image serves the prerendered SPA from nginx; `docker compose up` yields a working instance. |

---

## 🧰 Tools

All 24 tools process data **locally, in the browser** — every tool is air-gap-capable.

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radioastronomyio/ops-toolbox.git
cd ops-toolbox
npm install
npm run dev          # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test         # Single run — 474 tests, 56 files
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build        # Vite build + per-route prerender + sitemap/llms → dist/
npm run preview      # Preview the production build
```

The build emits `dist/` with one prerendered `index.html` per route (home, every tool, and `/about`), each carrying route-specific `<title>`, Open Graph, Twitter, and canonical meta canonical to `opstoolbox.dev`. It also writes `dist/sitemap.xml` (one `<url>` per route) and `dist/llms.txt` (an LLM-agent index derived from the tool registry), and serves `robots.txt` with the sitemap pointer — all keyed to `https://opstoolbox.dev`.

---

## 🐳 Self-Host (Docker)

The repo ships a multi-stage Docker image that builds the SPA and serves the prerendered site from nginx. The runtime container **makes no external network calls**, so it runs in a disconnected enclave — the air-gap claim is literally true inside the container.

```bash
docker compose up --build      # Build and serve on http://localhost:8080
```

Or build and run the image directly:

```bash
docker build -t ops-toolbox .
docker run -p 8080:80 ops-toolbox
```

To change the host port, edit `ports:` in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). The nginx config (`docker/nginx.conf`) serves each route's prerendered HTML when present and falls back to the SPA shell for unknown paths, mirroring `staticwebapp.config.json` — so deep links like `/subnet-calculator` unfurl with their own meta and client-side routing still works. `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, and `robots.txt` are served as themselves (not the SPA shell) on both Azure and the self-host image.

You can also deploy the `dist/` directory to any static host (Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, an S3 bucket) or serve it from any web server.

## 🏗 Architecture

Ops Toolbox is a React 18 SPA with code-split tool routes. Pure computation lives in `src/lib/` (testable without React), UI components in `src/tools/`, and shared primitives in `src/components/` and `src/hooks/`.

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  index.html │
                    │  + main.jsx │

### Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Implementation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Tool Registry | `src/lib/toolRegistry.js`, data-only module, no React imports | Single source of truth for routing, the directory grid, badges, and search |
| Code Splitting | `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` per tool route | Only load the tool the user navigates to |
| Logic Extraction | Pure functions in `src/lib/`, components in `src/tools/` | Testable without rendering; lib tests are fast |
| Shared Primitives | `useClipboard`, `useDebouncedValue`, `CopyButton`, `ErrorBanner` | Eliminate hand-rolled clipboard/debounce across 24 tools |
| Rejection Sampling | `src/lib/password.js` | Eliminate modulo bias in cryptographic random generation |
| Semantic Design Tokens | HSL CSS custom properties; raw Tailwind palette disabled | Consistent theming across Light / Dark / High-Contrast Slate / System |
| Per-Route Prerender | `scripts/prerender.mjs` | Route-specific title + social cards for SEO and link unfurls, no server needed |

## 🔒 Security Model

**Data handling:** All processing happens in your browser. There are no outbound requests during operation — open the DevTools Network tab and confirm it for yourself. The privacy claim is **unconditional**: every tool runs locally, there is no network-dependent code path, and the toolkit behaves identically with no network connection at all. Typography is covered too — Inter and JetBrains Mono are bundled via `@fontsource-variable`, so there is no external font CDN to leak the visit.

**Trust model:** You control the hosting. No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party scripts. The Docker image makes no external calls at runtime, so it runs in a fully air-gapped environment. Read the source, audit it, and run it behind your own perimeter.

**Cryptography:** Password generation uses the Web Crypto API with rejection sampling to eliminate modulo bias. SSH key generation uses node-forge's RSA implementation. UUID generation is cryptographically secure. No secrets are transmitted or stored.
