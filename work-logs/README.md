# Work Logs

Development history for ops-toolbox. Each milestone gets a subfolder with a README documenting decisions, outcomes, and artifacts.

---

## Structure

```
work-logs/
├── 01-ideation-and-setup/      # Repository scaffolding, docs, initial commit
├── milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md  # Standard M01/M02 procedure reference
└── README.md                   # This file
```

**Note:** This repository does not use GitHub Project tracking (no M02). Work is tracked dynamically via memory bank context updates.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Name | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [01](01-ideation-and-setup/README.md) | Ideation and Setup | ✅ Complete |
| [02](02-mermaid-renderer-implementation/README.md) | Mermaid Renderer Implementation | ✅ Complete |

## Conventions

- Folder naming: `NN-phase-name` (zero-padded, hyphenated)
- Each folder contains a `README.md` documenting that phase
- Scripts, configs, and artifacts live alongside the README
- Worklogs are synthesis documents (outcomes, not session transcripts)

---

## Procedure Reference

See [milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md](milestones-one-and-two-procedures.md) for standard M01/M02 execution patterns (used as reference even when M02 is skipped).

Use `docs/documentation-standards/worklog-readme-template.md` as the template for phase READMEs.
